# EmbeddedHexer
## An embedded Systems Project by Edward Speer for Caltech EE/CS 10b

This repo consists of the systems specification, all code outlines, and all code and definitions for an embedded hexer puzzle system. The system uses an Atmega64 controller to control a multiplexed LED display, and speaker along with to debounce user switch presses to play the game. For all details of the system, see the functional specification included within Outlines.
