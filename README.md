# EmbeddedHexer
## An embedded Systems Project by Edward Speer for Caltech EE/CS 10b

This repo consists of the systems specification, all code outlines, and all code and definitions for an embedded hexer puzzle system. The system uses an Atmega64 controller to control a multiplexed LED display, and speaker as well as to debounce and respond to user switch presses to play the game. For all details of the system, see the functional specification included within Outlines. To see the details of the hardware, see the system schematic pdf in the root directory of the repository.
