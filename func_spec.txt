Hexer Game

Functional Specification

  Description:  	The system is a Hexer game in which the user uses 5 switches to attempt to manipulate  
			the game configuration displayed on LEDs into the winning configuration via 5 legal moves.
			There is 7 segment display for indicating the current move number, and reset switches which
			allow both manual reset to a given configuration or game reset to a random configuration. 
			On game start there is a speaker which plays a short soundbyte, and upon winning the game, 
			the speaker also plays a distinct short soundbyte. In order to win the game, the user must 
			manipulate the game board via the 5 legal moves until all of the LEDs in the 15 LED display
			are turned ON.

  Global Variables:	WIN_STATE: The game board configuration corresponding to a victory for the player for 
				   the purpose of comparing the current game configuration to.


  Inputs:                All user input occurs through 6 switches:

                        |  Switch Name  |  Switch Type  |                        Description                      |
			|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
			|     START     |  Pushbutton   | Used to start a new game. Must be held down while one of|
			|		|		| either "Random Reset", "Manual Reset 1", or "Manual     |
			|		|		| Reset 0" is selected to indicate whether a random or    |
			|		|		| custom configuration is desired.			  |
			|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
			|   Move 1 /    |  Pushbutton   | When pressed during game play, this switch executes an  |
			| Random Reset	|        	| inversion of the inner hexagon on the game board, i.e   |
			|    (White)    |		| inversion of the states of LEDs 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, and 13. |
			|		|		|							  |
			|		|		| When pressed while the start button is held, this switch|
			|		|		| sets the initial game configuration to a psuedo-random  |
			|		|		| configuration.					  |
			|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
			|   Move 2 /    |  Pushbutton   | When pressed during game play, this switch executes a   |
			| Manual Reset 0|		| clockwise rotation of the right hexagon on the game     |
			|    (Black)    |		| board consisting of LEDs 4, 5, 10, 14, 13, and 8        |
			|		|		|							  |
			|		|		| When pressed while the START button is held, this switch|
			|		|		| shifts an OFF LED into the game configuration, which    |
			|		|		| acts as a shift register in manual reset mode.          |
			|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
			|   Move 3 /    |  Pushbutton   | When pressed during game play, this switch executes a   |  
			| Manual Reset 1|		| counterclockwise rotation of the states of the left     |
			|    (Blue)     |		| hexagon in the game board, consisting of LEDS 2, 3, 8,  |
			|		|		| 12, 11, and 6.					  |
			|		|		|							  |
			|		|		| When pressed while the START button is held, this switch|
			|		|		| shifts an ON LED into the game configuration, which acts|
			|		|		| as a shift register in manual reset mode.		  |
			|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
			|    Move 4     |  Pushbutton   | When pressed, this switch executes a clockwise rotation |
			|     (Red)     |		| of the upper triangle in the game board, consisting of  |
			|		|		| LEDS 1, 4, 9, 14, 13, 12, 11, 7, and 3.                 |
			|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
			|    Move 5     |  Pushbutton   | When pressed this switch executes a counterclockwise    |
			|   (Green)     |		| rotation of the lower triangle in the game board,       |
			|		|		| consisting of LEDs 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 13, 15, 12, and 7.    |

  Outputs:		4-digit 7-segment display:  Displays the current number of moves used by the player in
						    attempting to solve the puzzle since last resetting using the 
						    START button. When a user solves a puzzle which was initialized 
						    using the "Random Reset" option, the display indicates if the
						    player's number of moves is within the 10 lowest ever achieved
						    for a random game initialization on the system.

			15-LED display:             Displays the state of the current game board

			Speaker:                    Plays a sound effect which indicates the start of a new game
						    when one is started, and plays a victorious sound effect when
                                                    the player solves the puzzle.
			
			SD Card: 		    The top 10 scores lowest move numbers ever achieved by a user 
						    who initialized a game using the "Random Reset" option on the
						    system are stored on this card. Whenever a player wins from 
						    a random initialization, their number of moves is compared to
						    those stored on this card, and the player is informed if they 
						    are within the top 10.


  User Interface: 	The current game state is displayed on the 15 LEDs. The current number of moves used by 
			the player is displayed on the 4-digit 7 segment LED display. The user can use any of the 5
			switches corresponding to moves to manipulate the LED's in the game state as described above
			in "inputs". At any time, the user may reset the game state and the moves counter by holding  
			the START button, and pressing one of the random or manual reset switches. When these are 
                        pressed at the same time as the start switch they will reset the game as described in the 
                        "inputs" section above. Any time a user achieves a top 10 lowest move number after 
                        initializing a puzzle from a random reset, they are informed of their placement in the 
			top 10.

  Error Handling:	If there is a power failure, the system will reset to a psuedo-random configuration of the
			game board, with the 4-digit display showing 0 moves. The data saved on the SD card will 
			remain saved on the SD card, and only the previous current state of the game will be lost.

			If a player presses the START button but does not select one of either the "Random Reset"
			or the "Manual Reset _" switches, then the button will have no effect. The 4 digit display
			and 15 LED displays will continue to display the data of the current game session.

			If the move number used by the player overflows the 4 digit display, the system automatically 
			executes a psuedo-random reset and resets the move counter back to 0

  Algorithms: 		None

  Data Structures:	The current game board is stored as a 15 bit array, with one bit for the status of each
			LED. We then have 8 bits which indicate the current number of moves used by the player.

  Limitations:		None
